        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The extra feature of your choice is the mute and unmute button</p>
        <p class="hidden">A mute and unmute button is a useful component to a media player because it gives the user control over the audio output. Users may want to mute the audio temporarily for a variety of reasons, such as to avoid disturbing others in a shared environment, to listen to their own music, or to focus on the visual content. Conversely, users may want to unmute the audio when they are ready to listen to the content. Having a mute and unmute button easily accessible in the media player interface allows users to quickly toggle the audio on and off without having to navigate away from the media player or adjust the volume on their device. This feature enhances the overall user experience and makes the media player more versatile and accessible to a wider range of users.</p>
