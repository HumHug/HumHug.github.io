                <h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
                <p>One way to explore a developer's various projects is by hovering over or clicking on different elements within their portfolio. This can provide users with more detailed information on each project, such as the technologies used, the challenges overcome during development, and the outcomes achieved.</p>

                <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
                <p>One of the primary goals for the developer is to present their projects to potential clients in a compelling and visually appealing manner Through their portfolio. by having the information well presented and show their skills through links to other projects on their portfolio.</p>
            </li>

            <br>
            <li>
                <h3>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h3>
                <p>
                    It is extremely organised and easy to access having many functions to sort his projects by different coding languages or platforms making it easy for others to see what skills he has
                </p>
            </li>

            <br>
            <li>
                <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to fully explore and understand this website, it may take a few minutes to engage with the various interactions available. This can include reading through the site's pages, hoving over buttons for more information and clicking on different sections to uncover additional content.
                    
                    But the amount of times is as many as needed to view the different experiences is as much as a potential employer or someone wishing to collaborate with to see what experience the dev has with different languages and projects to see if he would be worth hiring.

                <p>when viewing the developer’s projects you enter a screen where each project is sorted by different coding languages, a media form it references is cue cards when hovering over each card there is a flipping animation that occurs, and different information about the project is shown.</p>

                <h3>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h3>

                <p>There are lots of layers to the website meaning to access a specific project there are many layers of clicking through buttons to get to the detailed descriptions or to get to the source code and files of a project. Granted this method does keep everything organized but will introduce mental fatigue trying to find a specific project twice.    </p>

                <p>The most satisfying aspects of the interaction are the animations of the cards flipping over there is also an addicting aspect to wanting to flip the cards over to read more about the project mak ing it a really effecting way top present projects by making the experience of looking at the projects entertaining.</p>
