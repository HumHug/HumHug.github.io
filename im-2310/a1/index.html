                <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>

                <h3>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h3>
                <p>
                    It is extremely organised and easy to access having many functions to sort his projects by different coding languages or platforms making it easy for others to see what skills he has

                    In order to fully explore and understand this website, it may take a few minutes to engage with the various interactions available.

                    But the amount of times is as many as needed to view the different experiences is as much as a potential employer or someone wishing to collaborate with to see what experience the dev has with different languages and projects to see if he would be worth hiring.
